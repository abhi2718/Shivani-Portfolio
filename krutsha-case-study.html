                        </blockquote>
                        <h4>The Challange</h4>
                        <p class="mb-30">
                          Designing Krutsha involved several UI/UX challenges,
                          including creating a child-friendly and intuitive
                          interface with simple navigation, large touch-friendly
                          elements, and engaging visuals. Maintaining a clear
                          visual hierarchy while balancing text, images, and
                          interactions was crucial to enhance usability.
                          Gamification elements like rewards and animations were
                          integrated to improve engagement, while accessibility
                          considerations ensured support for different learning
                          styles. Additionally, optimizing performance for
                          smooth interactions and refining the design through
                          user testing and feedback helped in delivering an
                          effective and enjoyable experience for young learners.
                        </p>
                        <h5>The Solution</h5>
                        <p class="mb-30">
                          To overcome these challenges, I designed a simple and
                          intuitive UI with large touch-friendly elements, clear
                          visual hierarchy, and an engaging color scheme
                          suitable for children. Gamification was integrated to
                          enhance engagement, while accessibility-focused design
                          ensured inclusivity for different learning styles.
                          Performance optimization techniques, along with user
                          testing and iterative improvements, helped refine the
                          experience, making Krutsha both interactive and
                          effective for young learners.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Objective</h4>
                        <p class="mb-30">
                          The objective of Krutsha is to ensure that students
                          can easily access the app while studying. Whenever
                          they have any doubts, they can resolve them instantly
                          using the SolveX feature. The app focuses on providing
                          a seamless user experience with high usability,
                          enabling students to learn and practice effectively.
                          Through quizzes, they can reinforce their knowledge
                          and memorize concepts efficiently. The Revise feature
                          helps them strengthen weak areas. The overall goal is
                          to ensure that users can complete their journey in
                          minimal steps, making the learning process smooth and
                          effective.

                          intelligent system that tracks students' performance
                          across different topics, highlighting weak areas based
                          on quiz results and study patterns. This feature
                          provides insights into learning progress and suggests
                          areas that need improvement.

                          The system dynamically generates practice questions
                          tailored to the student's weak topics. These questions
                          help in reinforcing concepts and ensuring mastery over
                          difficult subjects.

                          This educational mobile app empowers students with a
                          structured, AI-driven learning experience, enhancing
                          their understanding, retention, and problem-solving
                          skills. By integrating real-time AI assistance
                          (SolveX), interactive note-making (Jhatpat Notes),
                          retention-based tools (Memorise, Skim Learning), and
                          adaptive quizzes, the app ensures an engaging and
                          effective study process. The Practice section
                          reinforces learning through quizzes with explanations,
                          while the Revise module personalizes revision by
                          identifying weak areas and generating targeted
                          questions

                        <p>
                          During this project, I learned a lot about how to
                          implement a new feature and design a new screen
                          keeping the app identity. I also learned how to talk
                          to users and understand what they need without they
                          say this directly.

                          If you have any question I am available. Let's talk
                          about UX/UI . Feel free to add me on linkedin
