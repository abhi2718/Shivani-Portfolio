                          Prioritize clean, minimalistic designs with a focus on
                          typography and white space. Use high-quality,
                          appetizing images without overloading screens.
                          Maintain consistent layouts across pages for a
                          predictable user experience.

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <h4>Onboarding Screen</h4>
                        <!-- <p class="mb-30">
                          As a <strong>designer</strong> , we always need to
                          improve products and keep business aligned to user
                          needs. So for this study case, I was exercising how to
                          propose solutions under tight timelines (4 days) for a
                          highly adopted app in Brazil called iFood.
                        </p> -->
                        <p class="mb-30">
                          Purpose:The login screen serves as the gateway to the
                          app, ensuring a personalized user experience while
                          keeping user data secure. Design Features:Minimalistic
                          Layout: Background: Soft, gradient tones or a
                          high-quality food-related image for a welcoming feel.
                          App Logo: Placed prominently at the top for brand
                          recall. Login Options: Email and password input
                          fields.Social login buttons: Google, Apple, and
                          Facebook for quicker access. Clear "Forgot Password?"
                          link for easy recovery. Call-to-Action Buttons: "Log
                          In" and "Sign Up" buttons styled with vibrant colors
                          (e.g., green or orange) to signify health and action.
                          Onboarding Shortcut: Optional “Explore Without Login”
                          button for first-time users to browse limited
                          features. Key UX Considerations: Auto-focus on the
                          email field when the screen loads. Error messages with
                          friendly prompts (e.g., "Please enter a valid email
                          address").

                            research. Are you curious? Let's go.

                        <p class="mb-30">
                          At the beginning of the project, there wasn't much
                          time for researching so I choose to do a
                          <strong> <i>Guerrilla Research </i> </strong> to talk
                          to people and get some insights. Creating a new
                          feature is a common task in a designer's life, but
                          it's not as simple as it seems. New features can make
                          the app more complex to use and generate
                          <i>featurism</i>, so to avoid useless features I was
                          trying to understand what could really make the user
                          happier. So during interviews, I was paying attention
                          to the workaround users were used to doing in the app
                          to solve their specific needs, what are their
                          frustrations were about food delivery services, the
                          bad experiences they got with delivery services, and I
                          also tried to understand why people choose one app
                          instead of another or even what makes people stop
                          using an app.

                        <p class="mb-30">
                          As I said after the user research, I noticed
                          <strong>2 feature opportunities</strong>, but I had to
                          choose just one of them because of the time
                          constraints of the project. The
                          <strong>strategy</strong> that I chose was
                          <strong> to minimize user frustration</strong> while
                          using the app to create a solution to
                          <strong>improve the existing experience</strong>,
                          rather than creating another new feature from scratch
                          to solve a new problem. Put simply.
                          <strong>

                          Well, the user can spend time choosing what they want
                          to eat and when he tries to finalize the order he can
                          get this message:

                          sometimes the new address can be outside the delivery

                          address. At the moment, the user has two buttons
                          <strong>"Change the restaurant"</strong> to go back to
                          the main screen and lose the order or
                          <strong>"Not now"</strong> to go back to the chart

                          say this directly.
